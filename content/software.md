#### Financial Processes

Members can use web front ends to manage their account, payments
entered and invoices paid will be reflected all the way up Membership
System and into our financial system (Membership system acts as the
A/R front end to accounting system) which then feeds the data under
accounting department control to the actual accounting system
(transactions can be processed in detail or summarized to save space
and entries).  Online payments are processed automatically and tracked
so that a full daily reconciliation is automatically available.

Partners can use web front ends to manage and invoice for services,
including manual automated approval system which will be processed
internally all the way up to accounts payable. With the Ceridian
payment option; they can be paid electronically.

Using Microsoft technologies, Conamex developed a custom software solution called Snowpro, which automates and integrates member, financial, store front, insurance and course management processes within a single system.

The management software solution is run out of the CSIA office, which then manages the systems for the other two associations. The solution is currently being used by tens of thousands of students, teachers and coaches, in conjunction with over 350 ski schools across the globe.

Using the Snowpro Web site, members can pay for their annual dues, their courses, magazine subscriptions and more, all through a single interface.

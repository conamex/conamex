Using Microsoft technologies, Conamex developed a
custom software solution called Snowpro, which
automates and integrates member, financial, store
front, insurance and course management processes
within a single system.

The management software solution is run out of the
CSIA office, which then manages the systems for
the other two associations. The solution is
currently being used by tens of thousands of students,
teachers and coaches, in conjunction with over 350 ski
schools across the globe.

Using the Snowpro Web site, members can pay for their
annual dues, their courses, magazine subscriptions and
more, all through a single interface.

Conamex International, a past recipient of CDN’s Channel Elite Award for best small business solution, took home the top honour of being named this year’s Solution Provider of the Year.

The business and technology firm specializes in technologies which include collaboration, data management infrastructure and security for small to medium-sized businesses and branch offices of larger organizations.

It was Conamex’s work with the Canadian Ski Instructor’s Alliance (CSIA), the Canadian Ski Coach Federation (CSCF) and the Canadian Association Snowboard Instructors (CASI), that helped them land in the top spot at the annual Channel Elite Awards.

Using Microsoft technologies, Conamex developed a custom software solution called Snowpro, which automates and integrates member, financial, store front, insurance and course management processes within a single system.

The management software solution is run out of the CSIA office, which then manages the systems for the other two associations. The solution is currently being used by tens of thousands of students, teachers and coaches, in conjunction with over 350 ski schools across the globe.

Using the Snowpro Web site, members can pay for their annual dues, their courses, magazine subscriptions and more, all through a single interface.

Robert L’Esperance, CIO at Conamex said before CSIA implemented Snowpro, the association was using a proprietary database software that was very limited in nature.

Robert L’Esperance added that a lot of the previous processes were also being completed manually and were being passed from person to person.

“There was no real workflow,” he said. “A lot of extra hours were needed to get through all of the paper processing. We helped CSIA achieve a complete transformation so internally, staff can see what everyone else is doing and they can be more productive.”

With Snowpro, members from all three associations can access the membership database, regardless of where they are, by logging into their profile and membership record. Here, members can go online and register for courses, can change their addresses, and even make purchases through an online store. For internal users, staff can now execute on event management projects by using Snowpro’s automatic billing and service and business process capabilities as well.

#### Accpac Development Partner of the Year

August 21 -  Orlando, FL

_"Conamex’s president and head of software development, took the
main stage today to receive the **Accpac Development Partner of the Year 1995**
as the Computer Associates CA World event held in Orlando ,Florida.
On stage, Mr. L’Esperance was not only the recipient of the plaque
but also received a specially emblazoned Computer Associates leather
jacket to commemorate the award win._

_5 years after the first Payroll Direct software started shipping,
and with the addition of the Accounts Payable and the move to add
the Simply Accounting line to the product series tie-in Conamex was
the winner hands-down for delivering flawless software and timely
updates. In fact the people at Accpac admitted that in 5 years they
only had one complaint; and it turned out it was their error._

_'We have established the de facto standard in excellence for
seamless electronic banking throughout the Accpac and Simply
Accounting Series' said Robert L’Esperance CIO/CTO of Conamex.
'We have the strength of solid relationships with financial institutions
across Canada and with the NACHA banking standards council in the U.S.
giving us total breadth, depth and flexibility for Accpac and Simply
users. They have choices not only by bank but the ability to bank with
more than one institution and the U.S. as well. Employees can diversify
their paycheque so that they truly do not have to go to the bank every
week to ensure funds are where they need be.
And we’re bilingual too.', emphasized Mr. L’Esperance."_

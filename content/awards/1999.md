**ACCPAC Clients Cut Costs, Improve Cash Flow Management With Electronic Funds**

September 28 - Pleasanton, CA

_ACCPAC International, Inc., a business unit of Computer
Associates International Inc. (NYSE: CA) interBiz Solutions
division, announced today that it has acquired the entire
EFT Direct series from Conamex International. The EFT
solutions are available immediately for ACCPAC products
including ACCPAC(R) Corporate Series(TM), ACCPAC(R) Small
Business Series(TM), ACCPAC Plus(TM) Accounting and Simply
Accounting(R)._

_The EFT Direct products, designed for ACCPAC's leading
accounting lines, enable ACCPAC clients to manage
electronic deposits, payments and receipts through
Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) services of banks
throughout North America._

_"As the shift to e-business accelerates, ACCPAC continues
to integrate key functionality that gives our customers
and business partners clear competitive advantage," said
David Hood, ACCPAC's chief executive officer. "The addition
of these EFT technologies furthers our lead in delivering
the most complete and powerful e-business solution set
for the mid-market."_

_Moving funds electronically, such as electronic payment of
invoices and payroll, or direct debit of customer accounts,
rewards businesses in several ways. It reduces the costs and
time of traditional paper handling, improves cash flow
management, and ensures that funds are delivered to their
required destination. These benefits extend to a business'
employees, suppliers and clients._

_"Our track record of 11 years with ACCPAC clients provides
a solid foundation from which ACCPAC can increase its market
share in electronic banking," said Robert Lâ€™Esperance
CIO/CTO for Conamex. "By leveraging the alliances Conamex
has developed with major financial institutions, ACCPAC
can solidify its e-business leadership position."_

_"Just as TD Bank is dedicated to making banking easier for
customers, ACCPAC is showing leadership in providing innovative
electronic banking software," said Jeff Van Duynhoven, director
of Money Management Solutions at TD Bank. "Simply Accounting
allows us to better meet the needs of our customers by providing
a seamless interface between ACCPAC's EFT Direct products and
our EFT service. It also enables our customers to download TD
Bank statement details to ease reconciliation."_

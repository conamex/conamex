 ACCPAC Clients Cut Costs, Improve Cash Flow Management With Electronic Funds

PLEASANTON, Calif., Sept. 28 /PRNewswire/ -- ACCPAC International, Inc., a business unit of Computer Associates International Inc. (NYSE: CA) interBiz Solutions division, announced today that it has acquired the entire EFT Direct series from Conamex International. The EFT solutions are available immediately for ACCPAC products including ACCPAC(R) Corporate Series(TM), ACCPAC(R) Small Business Series(TM), ACCPAC Plus(TM) Accounting and Simply Accounting(R).

The EFT Direct products, designed for ACCPAC's leading accounting lines, enable ACCPAC clients to manage electronic deposits, payments and receipts through Electronic Funds Transfer
 (EFT) services of banks throughout North America.

"As the shift to e-business accelerates, ACCPAC continues to integrate key functionality that gives our customers and business partners clear competitive advantage," said David Hood, ACCPAC's chief executive officer. "The addition of these EFT technologies furthers our lead in delivering the most complete and powerful e-business solution set for the mid-market."

Moving funds electronically, such as electronic payment of invoices and payroll, or direct debit of customer accounts, rewards businesses in several ways. It reduces the costs and time of traditional paper handling, improves cash flow management, and ensures that funds are delivered to their required destination. These benefits extend to a business' employees, suppliers and clients.

"Our track record of 11 years with ACCPAC clients provides a solid foundation from which ACCPAC can increase its market share in electronic banking," said Robert Lâ€™Esperance CIO/CTO for Conamex. "By leveraging the alliances Conamex has developed with major financial institutions, ACCPAC can solidify its e-business leadership position."

"Just as TD Bank is dedicated to making banking easier for customers, ACCPAC is showing leadership in providing innovative electronic banking software," said Jeff Van Duynhoven, director of Money Management Solutions at TD Bank. "Simply Accounting allows us to better meet the needs of our customers by providing a seamless interface between ACCPAC's EFT Direct products and our EFT service. It also enables our customers to download TD Bank statement details to ease reconciliation."

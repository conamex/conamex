#### Microsoft Impact Awards Winner â€“ Security Solution of the Year

The winning solutions included a biomarker study program
written in VBA, for use in the biopharmaceutical industry.
It provided a step by step process for lab technicians that
also produced quantitative analysis, reports, mappings and
highlighted specific data that needed attention from lab
technicians. This new system created an unexpected and
immense improvement in efficiencies, centralized data
storage, retrieval and processing. The second nomination
impacted a client's network infrastructure solution that
virtually eliminated down time of systems using a myriad
of Microsoft's server and exchange products and features,
configured to support, among many things, a digital security
system and remote network monitoring on a 24/7 basis.
The client reduced, by up to 80%, the regular maintenance
operations previously required to manually update stations.

Triple Crown for Conamex International as they capture Gold at the CEA Awards

Caps wins for Software Asset Management and Small Business Specialist of the Year at the 2007 Microsoft IMPACT Awards

Toronto, Ontario – November 15, 2007 – Montreal based Conamex International announced today that it has won gold in the Best Small Business Solution category at the fifth annual Channel Elite Awards.  This award caps wins for both Software Asset Management Solution of the Year and Small Business Specialist of the Year categories at the 2007 Microsoft Partner Program IMPACT Awards exactly one week ago.

The annual CEA Awards recognize Canadian technology partners’ and their commitment and leadership by the technology publication industry. CDN – Computer Dealer News, Canada’s No. 1 IT channel publication recognizes these individuals and companies and rewards them with the prestigious Channel Elite Award.

The Best Small Business Solution award honors the partner that has created the most innovative and problem solving hardware, networking, online or software-based solution for an organization or department with up to 100 seats using the solution.

Conamex was chosen as the winner for their two fold solution built using Microsoft Groove 2007 to manage IT assets and its ability to synchronize seamlessly with Microsoft Sharepoint Server,  that also addresses several areas of concern for Quality Control departments including collaboration, workflow, document integrity, security and retention. 

Conamex was last year’s CEA gold winner for Best Small Business Solution. Conamex has accumulated awards for the last 4 years running.  In 2006 they were the winners of the Microsoft World Partner Conference Award for Licensing Technology Solution of the Year.

Conamex, along with other technology partner winners and finalists in each of the award categories, were honored at a gala event in Toronto on November 14, 2007.







This year, its QC MOSS solution created for Ibex Technologies Inc.'s quality control (QC) department took home the top honours.

Robert L’Esperance, President of Conamex International, a Microsoft-centric company that provides consulting, deployment and technology management services, said the solution it created is scalable because it can also be duplicated in any environment and/or industry where a QC department is present.

In the case of Ibex, Mr. L’Esperance said previously a lot of documentation was paper-based and was being processed manually, which was not only time-consuming but also created unnecessary workflow. Ibex therefore went to Conamex to create a solution that would help save time and would be both scalable and secure.

“The result was a solution that was based on Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) that also incorporated Groove technology,” Mr. L’Esperance said. “Groove is a desktop application that is part of the Microsoft Office 2007 platform and we synched it with this solution to help [Ibex] better manage their IT assets.”

One of the most common mistakes most IT administrators make, Mr. L’Esperance says, is that they often think about their company's visible physical possessions and not enough about their invisible assets.


 


“Companies always think about how many desks or cabinets they have and they forget that their most precious asset is information, such as their

licensing technology,” he said. “The key with our solution is that in the event of a disaster, data including warranties, licensing, insurance information, emergency phone numbers and so forth, always can be available to the IT administrator.”

Because the application is based on MOSS and Groove, Mr. L’Esperance says if disaster were to strike, companies can be up and running in just a matter of hours instead of days or weeks. This, he says, is because the software asset management is copied both in-house and out-house.

“Groove allows for the remote collaboration of data without having to go through the server,” Mr. L’Esperance said. “Now, [Ibex] has a back-up system with our solution. It was well worth it for them as a small business to go this route.”

Mr L’Esperance is also eager to offer advice to other MOSS solution providers by saying Groove is a key technology that when synched with MOSS, works incredibly and unbelievably well.

“It's like the golden nugget that no one knows is sitting there,”he said. “It's really useful and makes work life so much better. MOSS needs to be looked at by anyone in the industry, whether it's internal IT or outsourcing companies. These collaboration tools are having a huge impact on the productivity for both big and small companies alike.”

In short, Mr. L’Esperance is thrilled with the win in this category.

“It's all the more gratifying when you actually come out on top,” he adds.
